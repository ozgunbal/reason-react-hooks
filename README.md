# ReasonReact Example with Hooks

This is:

- A template for your new ReasonReact project.
- A collection of thin examples illustrating ReasonReact usage.
- Extra helper documentation for ReasonReact (full ReasonReact docs [here](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)).

## Run

```sh
yarn
yarn server
# in a new tab
yarn start
```

Open a new web page to `http://localhost:8000/`. Change any `.re` file in `src` to see the page auto-reload. **You don't need any bundler when you're developing**!

**How come we don't need any bundler during development**? We highly encourage you to open up `index.html` to check for yourself!
