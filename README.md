# ReasonReact Example with Hooks

This is:

- A template for your new ReScript project.
- A collection of thin examples illustrating ReScript usage.
- Extra helper documentation for ReScript (full ReScript docs [here](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/react/latest/introduction)).

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run re:start
# in a new tab
npm start
```

Open a new web page to `http://localhost:8000/`. Change any `.res` file in `src` to see the page auto-reload. **You don't need any bundler when you're developing**!

**How come we don't need any bundler during development**? We highly encourage you to open up `index.html` to check for yourself!
